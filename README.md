### 1. Project Motivation
#
In this project we focused retail analysis with Walmart data and answer the following questions:<br/>

1.Which stores have maximum and sales?<br/>
2.Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot?. Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation.<br/>
3.Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate in Q3â€™2012?<br/>
4.Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together.<br/>
5.Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights.<br/>
6.Build prediction to forecast demand.<br/>
